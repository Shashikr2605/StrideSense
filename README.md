# GaitXpert

# Project Description

**GaitXpert** is an innovative gait analysis platform that combines cutting-edge computer vision techniques with machine learning algorithms to provide comprehensive analysis of human walking patterns. This project addresses the growing need for objective, automated gait assessment in clinical and research settings.

## Core Functionality

The system processes video input to extract key gait parameters including stride length, cadence, step width, and temporal symmetry. Using advanced pose estimation and biomechanical modeling, GaitXpert identifies subtle abnormalities that may indicate neurological conditions, musculoskeletal disorders, or rehabilitation progress.

## Technical Approach

Built on robust machine learning frameworks, the platform employs convolutional neural networks for pose detection, time-series analysis for gait cycle identification, and classification algorithms for pattern recognition. The system integrates multiple data streams to provide holistic gait assessment with clinical-grade accuracy.

## Target Applications

GaitXpert serves healthcare professionals, researchers, and clinicians working in rehabilitation medicine, neurology, and sports science. The platform supports early diagnosis of conditions like Parkinson's disease, stroke recovery monitoring, and athletic performance optimization.

## Impact and Value

By automating complex gait analysis traditionally requiring expensive equipment and specialized expertise, GaitXpert democratizes access to advanced biomechanical assessment. The system reduces analysis time from hours to minutes while maintaining diagnostic accuracy, making it invaluable for clinical practice and large-scale research studies.

The project represents a significant advancement in digital health technology, offering scalable, cost-effective solutions for gait-related healthcare challenges.
